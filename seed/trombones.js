    remarks: "Bell is from a trumpet; according to Fischer, additional parts were later added to an original trumpet bell. Tubular slide stays with chased tendril pattern on dotted background. Some ferrules have chased scale pattern; others are similar, but with a eingeschlagenes Stabmuster**** [hammered staff design] on one end; still others are like the last, but wtih toothed pattern on one end. 3 ferrules on bell section have simple ring pattern and are probably of later date. Flat bell stay and adjacent sleeve haveembossed tendril pattern on dotted background, diagonal strokes; rings in slide bow and bell bow, mounted on plate; these plates and plate adjacent to hinge on bell stay have engraved zigzag pattern. Garland with raised rim wire with scale pattern. Signature and date on hatched background."

    remarks: "A cut-down bass; end of bell sec. may be the only orig. element (according to Fischer 1989: 44). Detailed measurements of bell-sec. bore, graph of bell expansion in Myers A 1998. ****McGowan says slide stay has two eyelets. Check Thein article. Downey 1997: 10 suggests that the authentic portions of this instrument may have been part of an order of instruments that were received from Georg Neuschel by the Danish court in 1557. Hole in immoveable slide stay, which may originally have been the moveable slide stay (reversed), where a handle could have been attached. Garland is in two parts—appears to have been attached to bell at a later date (Hannes). Two holes in bell stay. Hinges on slide stays may be new work (Hannes)."
